LA Shopz is a project that was started and nearly completed at UCLA during the LAHacks 2017 Hackathon (March 31st - April 2nd).

LA Shopz is an attempt to implement a shopping website that will allow customeres who visit the site to browse a number of products in the inventory. Customers can add desired items to their cart and view the items that they wish to "purchase" in their cart.

The final part of the project, the checkout page, was nearly completed before the team ran out of time to complete the project.

Key technologies used for the project include NodeJS and ExpressJS, technologies that each team member gained great practice and experience from.
